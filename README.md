# Smart-Career-Predictor-AI
I recently built a Smart Career Predictor web application that uses Machine Learning to recommend suitable career paths based on a user’s skills, interests, and academic background.

🔍 What this project does:

Collects user inputs through a web interface

Processes and transforms data using Python

Applies a trained ML model to predict career outcomes

Displays results in a simple and user-friendly way

🛠 Tech Stack:

Python

Flask

Machine Learning (scikit-learn)

HTML & CSS

💡 This project helped me understand how to integrate ML models into real-world web applications, from backend logic to user interaction.

Excited to keep learning and building more AI-driven solutions!
